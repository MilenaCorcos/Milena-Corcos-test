Born in France, I studied my Bachelor and Master of Science in Switzerland, and I was awarded my PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) in Northern Germany at the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmoltz Center for Polar and Marine research, and at the university of Bremen. After a PostDoc at McGill university, I am now a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at NASA GISS in New York City through a collaboration with Columbia university.  
 - I have been working on high resolution sea ice modeling for climate simulations. As we increased the resolution of the climate models, we now have the power to resolve more features in the sea ice cover, like leads (fracture lines) and large ice floes. The question is now to know if what we are modeling is correct compared to the observations.
 - I now focus on long term sea level rise prediction through the coupling betweeen the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) and the NASA climate model modelE.

### #SciComm

I'm interested in sharing knowledge to the public about climate change and the impact of human activities on the polar region.

### Personal life

My personnal interests are going from international politics, scoutism, science fiction books and movies, ecology and environmental protection, radio and podcasting, and photography (film and digital).
