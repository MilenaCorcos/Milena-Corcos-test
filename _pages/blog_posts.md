I'm sometimes writing small blog articles on the ArcTrain Blog or other, e.g. the Polarstern Blog during expedition. Here is a list of links:

- [**Measuring ice and snow thickness : Poke it with a stick**](https://blogs.helmholtz.de/polarstern/en/2018/10/measuring-ice-and-snow-thickness-poke-it-with-a-stick/) - *On the Polarstern Blog*
- [**Brittany, pancakes and sea ice â€“ common points!**](https://arctrain.de/brittany-pancakes-and-sea-ice-common-points/) - *On the ArcTrain Blog*
- [**Starting up a PhD**](https://arctrain.de/starting-up-a-phd/) - *On the ArcTrain blog*
