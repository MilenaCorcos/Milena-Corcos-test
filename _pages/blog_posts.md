I'm sometimes writing some small blog articles on the ArcTrain Blog or other, e.g. the Polarstern Blog during expedition. Here is a list :

- [Measuring ice and snow thickness : Poke it with a stick](https://blogs.helmholtz.de/polarstern/en/2018/10/measuring-ice-and-snow-thickness-poke-it-with-a-stick/)
- [Brittany, pancakes and sea ice â€“ common points!](https://arctrain.de/brittany-pancakes-and-sea-ice-common-points/)
