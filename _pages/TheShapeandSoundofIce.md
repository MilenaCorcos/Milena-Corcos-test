*The Shape and Sound of Ice* is a personal multimedia and vulgarisation project, made of photgraphs and sound recordings.

Sea ice is not a uniform medium, it is a substance that is worked by the meteorologic conditions, pushed by the wind, broken by the waves, it piles itself, it is nurtured by snow from above, increased by sea water from below. It takes so many shapes and forms, so many material properties. It softly deforms with the waves when it is thin. It is also incredibly strong when it is thick, so strong that it can crush unprepared ships. It is also a place of life, It harbours many species. Seals, walruss, polarbears, foxe, fishes, planktons, or shrimps.

During my PhD in 2018, I joined the Scientific Expedition PS115.2 aboard the german icebreaker. We spent more than 4 weeks in central Arctic, steaming through the ice. I recorded the sound of sea ice as the ship go through it, break it and create its way. I have also compiled pictures of the different shapes that ice can take. 

I would recommand to listen to the recording (with headphones) while looking at the pictures. Enjoy!
