The Shape of Ice is small multimedia artistic and vulgarisation project, made of photgraphs and sound recordings.

Ice is often not a uniform medium, it is a substance that is worked by the meteorologic conditions, pushed by the wind, broken by the waves, it piles itself, it is nurtured by snow from above, increase by sea water from below, and . It takes so many shapes and forms, so many material properties, softly deformed by the waves when thin, of incredibly resistant when thick.

It is also a place of like, host seals, walruss, polarbears, fishes, planktons, or shrimps.
